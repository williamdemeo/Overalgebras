Overalgebras
============

GAP routines for constructing new finite algebras by extending and expanding transitive G-sets.

These routines accompany the paper "Expansions of finite algebras and their congruence lattices," 
which is available in this repository.  (The original is also available at springerlink.com.)

gap2uacalc.g can be used on its own to convert GAP groups and G-sets into UACalc .ua files,
which can then be imported into the Universal Algebra Calculator (http://uacalc.org).

See http://universalalgebra.wordpress.org/documentation/gap/gap-and-uacalc/ for more information about gap2uacalc.g
