Overalgebras
============

This repository contains the final version of my paper, "Expansions of finite algebras and their congruence lattices," that appears in Algebra Universalis, 69, 2013.  Also included are the GAP programs for constructing new finite algebras by extending and expanding transitive G-sets, as described in the paper.

The published version of the paper is in the file DeMeo-Expansions-AU-2013.pdf, which is also available at springerlink.com.

gap2uacalc.g can be used on its own to convert GAP groups and G-sets into UACalc .ua files,
which can then be imported into the Universal Algebra Calculator (http://uacalc.org).

See http://universalalgebra.wordpress.org/documentation/gap/gap-and-uacalc/ for more information about gap2uacalc.g
