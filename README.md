============

This repository contains the final version of a journal article by William DeMeo,

[Expansions of finite algebras and their congruence lattices][], *Algebra Universalis*, **69**, 2013.  

Also included are the GAP programs for constructing new finite algebras by
extending and expanding transitive G-sets, as described in the paper. 

The published version of the paper is in the file [DeMeo-Expansions-AU-2013.pdf][],
and is also available at [springer.com][]. 

In the file [gap2uacalc.g][] is a GAP program that can be used on its own to convert GAP groups and G-sets into UACalc .ua files,
which can then be imported into the [Universal Algebra Calculator](http://uacalc.org).
See [universalalgebra.org][] for more information about [gap2uacalc.g][].

For questions, comments, or suggestions please [submit an issue][].
